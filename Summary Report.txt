Dear,

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used webpages for (https://lifecharger.org)
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server 000.000.000.00.

35 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 1.750 And Total Concurrent API requested: 105.
40 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 1.27 And Total Concurrent API requested:  120.
45 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 1.8 And Total Concurrent API requested:   135.
52 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 1.3 And Total Concurrent API requested:   156.

While executed 52 concurrent request, found 1 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.64%.

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 150 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report from the attachment and let me know if you have any further queries.
